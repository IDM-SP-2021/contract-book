# Project Overview

*afiye* is a family oriented social network platform with the goal to provide a central repository for families to store their memories. No more tracking down your sibling for pictures of your child's birthday party, everyone can collaborate on creating a memory.

This social network is designed to reinforce and strengthen connections that you already have through blood and family relations. We are not replacing platforms like Facebook or Instagram which focus on social media that is driven by attention through likes and comments. On *afiye* posts are memories that are meant to be living collections of media that can be updated at any point.

## Project Terminology

  - **Inactive Node:** A node that is not connected to a user account by can still be tagged in memories to signify that they were involved with it. The profile information is basic, but enough to understand how the individual is related to everyone in the Family Network. These can be made active when a new user creates an account.
- **Family Member:** An individual person that is a member of a family network.
- **Memory:** A container for media that can be updated continuously. Additional Family Members can be tagged an included in a memory to mark who was a part of the memory and also allow them to contribute media to the memory.

- **Album:** A collection of memories for users to organize the memories. These can be centered around themes, time frames, or any other way a user may want to organize their memories. Some examples could be *Alice's Birthdays*, *Smith Family Christmases*, or *Kids Age 1-5*
