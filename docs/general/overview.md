# Project Overview

*afiye* is a family oriented social network platform with the goal to provide a central repository for families to store their memories. No more tracking down your sibling for pictures of your child's birthday party, everyone can collaborate on creating a memory.

This social network is designed to reinforce and strengthen connections that you already have through blood and family relations. We are not replacing platforms like Facebook or Instagram which focus on social media that is driven by attention through likes and comments. On *afiye* posts are memories that are meant to be living collections of media that can be updated at any point.
