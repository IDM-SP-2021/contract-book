# Project Overview

*afiye* is a family oriented social network platform with the goal to provide a central repository for families to store their memories digitally. Everyone can collaborate on creating a memory and populate the family tree.

This social network is designed to reinforce and strengthen connections that you already have through blood and family relations. We are different from other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram that are focused on creating or expanding your personal network through mutuals and user generated content. We are thinking smaller and more intimate, focusing on the network of family connections you already have. We are not encouraging expanding your network or creating validation through likes and comments, only encouraging users to share their memories with their families. On *afiye* posts are memories that are meant to be living collections of media which can be updated at any point by the people who created them and are in them.

## Project Terminology

- **Node:** A container for a Family Member. This is represented in either the Tree View. This Family Member can either be active or inactive on the platform.
  - **Active Node:** A node that is connected to an active user account that contains detailed profile of the individual.
  - **Inactive Node:** A node that is not connected to a user account but can still be tagged in memories to signify that the Family Member was involved in it. The profile information is basic, but enough to understand who the individual is and how they are related to everyone in the Family Network. These Inactive Nodes can be made active when a new user creates an account after the Node is created. In other words, there does not need to be an account linked to a Node upon its immediate creation.
- **Family Member:** An individual that is a member of a Family Network.
- **Family Network:** A group of nodes pertaining to one family tree containing at least one Active Node in which Memories and Albums can be shared.
- **Memory:** A container for image media that can be updated continuously by Family Members within a Family Network after its initial creation. These containers are flexible in that Family Members can be tagged at its creation or at any point. Media contained within a Memory can be updated or removed at any point.
- **Album:** A collection of memories for a user to organize the memories. These can be centered around themes, time frames, or any other way the user may want to organize their memories.
- **Tree View:** An interactive diagram view displaying all Nodes in a Family Network
